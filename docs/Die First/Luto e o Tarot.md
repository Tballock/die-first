## 🎭 **Stages of Transition & Their Arcana**

| **Stage**      | **Tarot Card**                  | **Description**  |
|---------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Denial**    | **🌙 The Moon**                | The Moon represents **illusion, confusion, and the inability to see reality clearly**. Just as in denial, where one **refuses to accept loss**, this card embodies **uncertainty and self-deception**. |
| **Anger**     | **⚡ The Tower**                | The Tower signifies **sudden collapse, destruction, and upheaval**. In the anger stage, **intense emotions surge**, shaking the emotional foundations—just as **The Tower crumbles under its own weight**. |
| **Bargaining**| **🔗 The Hanged Man**           | The Hanged Man symbolizes **sacrifice, waiting, and seeking new perspectives**. In bargaining, one **tries to negotiate or alter fate**, mirroring the card’s **pause and surrender**. |
| **Depression**| **💔 Three of Swords**          | The Three of Swords is the card of **emotional pain, deep sorrow, and heartbreak**. It reflects **the raw suffering** experienced in the depression stage of loss and realization. |
| **Acceptance**| **☠️ Death**                   | Death does not mean an end—it represents **transformation, rebirth, and new beginnings**. It aligns with the acceptance phase, where one **embraces the end of a cycle and steps into the unknown**. |

## 🔥 **Integration into Gameplay**
Each of these cards will **shape key turning points** in the game, altering the **world, player abilities, and narrative choices**. Progression through these stages is **not linear**, and the deeper one goes, the more **the labyrinth reshapes itself**.
